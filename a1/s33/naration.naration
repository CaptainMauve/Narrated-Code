declare index to determine the line readed
declare i to determine the letter read in the line



parsing lines, charactere by charactere

check the letter of the actual charactere

declare the varibale that will be used like code compiled
init index to 0 to read all the notes
declare variable of waiting time (400 because of the time of the wav files)


check the letter in the note_parsed

create the adequate code to set the timer function
create the adequate code to play the song
